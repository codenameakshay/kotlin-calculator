## Getting Started

To build on MacOS or Windows, please follow these simple steps.

**Step 1:**

**Step 2:**

Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio) to install Android Studio. Then you're ready to build the app.

For testing the app you can create an emulator following the steps [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator), or directly run on a physical Android device.
